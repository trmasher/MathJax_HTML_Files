<h1>
Statement of the Problem
</h1>
<p>The p-median problem is an application of linear optimization approaches with respect to a graph. Specifically, it is a facility-location model with the purpose of locating <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> facilities (hereafter referred to as vertices or nodes) to minimize a constraint equation based on weighted average distances between demand nodes and selection location nodes.</p>
<p>
Stated more formally, given some graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> where <span class="math display">\[V=(v_1,\ldots,v_n: n \in \Bbb N)\]</span> is a set of nodes of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, each representing a demand weight, and where <span class="math display">\[E=(e_1,\ldots,e_m: m \in \Bbb N)\]</span> is a set of connected nodes of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the p-median problem seeks to find any number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> vertices such that the sum of the weighted distances from each vertex in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> to the closest facility is minimized. The lengths between each vertex and each facility is calculated by taking the absolute value of each member of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> that represents a successive path connection of nodes in between the two and computing their sum.
</p>
<p>
In this paper, we will be discussing how exactly this calculation is performed. Three sections will be covered:
<ul>
<li>
Rectifying the Issue of Computational Complexity
</li>
<li>
Setting up the p-median Problem as a Linear Programming Problem
</li>
<li>
Finding a Solution to a Linear Programming Problem
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>
Rectifying the Issue of Computational Complexity
</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, when attempting to perform optimization calculations for this problem using a general graph, the computation time is <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal N \mathcal P\)</span>-hard. We can rectify this however by formulating the problem using a mathematical tree.</p>
<p>
Given some graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> where <span class="math display">\[V=(v_1,\ldots,v_n: n \in \Bbb N)\]</span> is a set of nodes of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and where <span class="math display">\[E=(e_1,\ldots,e_m: m \in \Bbb N)\]</span> is a set of connected nodes of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, we call the graph <span class="math inline">\(T=G\)</span> a <b>tree</b> if it is undirected, connected, and contains no cycles. From the procedures detailed in (Benkoczi et al.)<sup><a href="#section1">[i]</a></sup>, if <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a both rooted and binary tree, then an <span class="math inline">\(O(nlog^{p+2}n)\)</span> algorithm exists; thus, a solution to the p-median problem on <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> can be computed in polynomial time.
</p>
<p>
If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is not rooted, then it can be made to be so by arbitrarily selecting a vertex to designate as its root. If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is not binary, then <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> may be made to be binary by adding a linear number of vertices and edges to that set. Because it follows that any object that is composed of a linear function of objects that can be solved in polynomial time is itself solvable in polynomial time, then it follows that a tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> which is neither rooted nor binary can also be solved in polynomial time.
</p>
<p>
Thus, because the graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> for the p-median problem can be formulated as the tree <span class="math inline">\(T=G\)</span>, it follows that we can calculate a solution for the p-median problem in polynomial time.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<h1>
Setting up the p-median Problem as a Linear Programming Problem
</h1>
<p>
Now that we have established that we can find a solution to the p-median problem in polynomial time by setting up the problem as a tree, we desire to formulate the p-median problem as a linear programming problem. The form for the general linear programming problem is as follows:
<blockquote>
Minimize <span class="math display">\[f(\mathbf X) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i \tag{1}\label{eq1}\]</span> subject to <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} x_i = b_j \forall \ j=1,2,\ldots,m \tag{2}\label{eq2}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[x_i\ge 0, \forall \ i=1,2,\ldots,n \tag{3}\label{eq3}\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[a_{ij},c_i \in \Bbb R \text{, } b_j \ge 0 \text{, and } m\lt n \tag{4}\label{eq4}\]</span>
</blockquote>
<p>
We will first find the total cost as a function of any given collection of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> vertices from our set of nodes; we will refer to this function as the <b>objective function</b>. Once this is done, we will use this objective function to formulate the p-median problem in the form of the general linear programming problem. We divide these two procedures into two subsections.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>
Formulating the Objective Function
</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T=G\)</span> be as before, and let <span class="math display">\[F_p=(\mathscr f_1,\dots,\mathscr f_p:p\leq n \in \Bbb N)\]</span> be a collection of some <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> vertices in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> which represent a potential facility-location set (hereafter referred to as <i>median set</i>) for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Let <span class="math display">\[W=(w_1,\ldots,w_n:n \in \Bbb N)\]</span> be such that <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> represents the weight for vertex <span class="math inline">\(v_i \in V\)</span>; similarly, define <span class="math display">\[A=(a_1,\ldots,a_m:m \in \Bbb N)\]</span> to be the distance between adjacent vertices such that, if <span class="math display">\[e_k=(e_{k_1},e_{k_2})\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(e_{k_1},e_{k_2} \in V\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[a_k=\lvert e_k\rvert=\lvert e_{k_1} - e_{k_2} \rvert,\forall \ e_k \in E\]</span></p>
<p>
Let the (tree-metric) distance between any two arbitrary vertices <span class="math inline">\(v_i,v_j \in V\)</span> be denoted as <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span>, then define the mapping <span class="math inline">\(\psi:v_i \mapsto \psi(v_i)\)</span> to be the minimum weighted distance between vertex <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> and any facility within the potential median set; that is, <span class="math display">\[\psi(v_i)=w_i \cdot\min_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p}d_{v_i,\mathscr f_z}\]</span> Finally, let the potential cost of locating a facility at the location <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr f_z\)</span> be defined as the mapping <span class="math inline">\(\gamma:\mathscr f_z \mapsto \gamma(\mathscr f_z)\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
We are now ready to formulate our objective function for any given potential median set: we define the mapping <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma: F_p \mapsto \Gamma(F_p)\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[\Gamma(F_p)=\sum_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \gamma(\mathscr f_z) +\sum_{v_i \in V} \psi(v_i)\]</span> to be the objective function for any given potential median set <span class="math inline">\(F_p \subseteq V\)</span>.
</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>
Creating the General Linear Programming Problem
</h2>
<p>Because we wish to select from any arbitrary potential median set the one for which the objective function is minimized, our goal in solving the p-median problem is to find the median set <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr F_p\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[\mathscr F_p = \min_{F_p \subseteq V} \Gamma (F_p)\]</span> We will show that, with a few adjustments in terminology and symbology, this <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr F_p\)</span> fits the form of <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq1}\)</span></p>
