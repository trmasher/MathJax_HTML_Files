# Statement of the Problem

The p-median problem is an application of linear optimization approaches with respect to a graph. Specifically,  it is a facility-location model with the purpose of locating $p$ facilities (hereafter referred to as vertices or nodes) to minimize a constraint equation based on weighted average distances between demand nodes and selection location nodes.

<p>
  Stated more formally, given some graph $G=(V,E)$ where 
  $$V=(v_1,\ldots,v_n: n \in \Bbb N)$$ is a set of nodes of $G$, each representing a demand weight, and where 
  $$E=(e_1,\ldots,e_m: m \in \Bbb N)$$ is a set of connected nodes of $G$, the p-median problem seeks to find any number $p$ vertices such that the sum of the weighted distances from each vertex in $G$ to the closest facility is minimized. The lengths between each vertex and each facility is calculated by taking the absolute value of each member of $E$ that represents a successive path connection of nodes in between the two and computing their sum.
</p>

<p>
  In this paper, we will be discussing how exactly this calculation is performed. Three sections will be covered:
  <ul>
  <li>Rectifying the Issue of Computational Complexity</li>
  <li>Setting up the p-median Problem as a Linear Programming Problem</li>
  <li>Finding a Solution to a Linear Programming Problem</li>
  </ul>

# Rectifying the Issue of Computational Complexity
Unfortunately, when attempting to perform optimization calculations for this problem using a general graph, the computation time is $\mathcal N \mathcal P$-hard. We can rectify this however by formulating the problem using a mathematical tree.

<p>
  Given some graph $G=(V,E)$ where
  $$V=(v_1,\ldots,v_n: n \in \Bbb N)$$
  is a set of nodes of $G$, and where
  $$E=(e_1,\ldots,e_m: m \in \Bbb N)$$ is a set of connected nodes of $G$, we call the graph $T=G$ a <b>tree</b> if it is undirected, connected, and contains no cycles. From the procedures detailed in (Benkoczi et al.)<sup><a href="#section1">[i]</a></sup>, if $T$ is both <b>rooted</b> (meaning that there exists a hierarchy within the tree such that one node is considered to be at the ultimate level) and <b>binary</b> (meaning that for any 'parent' node, there are at most two 'child' nodes directly below them; taking "below" to mean "at a lower level with respect to the root hierarchy", 'parent' to mean "superior to the child with respect to the hierarchy", and 'child' to mean "inferior to the parent with respect to the hierarchy"), then an $O(nlog^{p+2}n)$ algorithm exists; thus, a solution to the p-median problem on $T$ can be computed in polynomial time.
</p>

  A rooted, binary tree. Note that the designating any other node attached to two or fewer other vertices would once again result in a rooted, binary tree.
  </figure>
</div>

<p>
  If $T$ is not rooted, then it can be made to be so by arbitrarily selecting a vertex to designate as its root. If $T$ is not binary, then $T$ may be made to be binary by adding a linear number of vertices and edges to that set. Because it follows that any object that is composed of a linear function of objects that can be solved in polynomial time is itself solvable in polynomial time, then it follows that a tree $T$ which is neither rooted nor binary can also be solved in polynomial time.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, because the graph $G$ for the p-median problem can be formulated as the tree $T=G$, it follows that we can calculate a solution for the p-median problem in polynomial time.
</p>

<br>





# Setting up the p-median Problem as a Linear Programming Problem
<p>
  Now that we have established that we can find a solution to the p-median problem in polynomial time by setting up the problem as a tree, we desire to formulate the p-median problem as a linear programming problem. The form for the general linear programming problem is as follows:
<blockquote>
  Minimize
  $$f(\mathbf X) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_i \tag{1}\label{eq1}$$
  subject to
  $$\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} x_i = b_j \forall \ j=1,2,\ldots,m \tag{2}\label{eq2}$$
  and 
  $$x_i\ge 0, \forall \ i=1,2,\ldots,n \tag{3}\label{eq3}$$ where 
  $$a_{ij},c_i \in \Bbb R \text{, } b_j \ge 0 \text{, and } m\lt n \tag{4}\label{eq4}$$
</blockquote>

<p>
  We will begin by defining the terminology of bipartite graphs to make use of in subsequent calculations. Next, we will formulate the the total cost as a function of any given collection of $p$ vertices from our set of nodes; we will refer to this function as the <b>objective function</b>. Once this is done, we will use this objective function to formulate the p-median problem in the form of the general linear programming problem. We divide these procedures into three subsections.
</p>

<br>




## Bipartite Graphs
At this point, we will define the concept of bipartite graphs to make use of later. Suppose $G=(V,E)$ is a graph;; that is, $G$ is an ordered pair $G=(V,E)$ comprised of $V$, a set of nodes or "vertices", as well as $E$, a set of edges or "links". For bipartite graphs, the only (fundamental) change is that we now divide the vertex set $V$ into two disjoint and independent subsets of vertices; that is,
$$X,Y : X \cap Y = \emptyset \text{ and } X \cup Y = V $$
Furthermore, an additional restriction is placed upon each edge element: if $e_k \in E$ is any edge of $G$, then $e_k$ connects an element in $X$ to an element in $Y$; that is,
$$\text{if } e_k = (v_{e_k},v_{e_k}') \in E \text{, then } v_{e_k} \in X \iff v_{e_k}' \in Y$$

  </div>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>
  A property of trees is that every tree is a bipartite graph. To prove this, begin with some rooted tree $T$ (if $T$ is not rooted, any arbitrarily selected node to serve as the root may be selected). We will adopt the notation "an <b>odd</b>/<b>even</b> child" to indicate a node that is an odd/even number of levels beneath the root node with respect to the hierarchy, respectively. 
</p>
<p>
  Define the set $X \subset V$ to be the collection of all such nodes within $V$ that are either even children of the root node or the root node itself; define the set $Y \subset V$ to be the collection of all such nodes within $V$ that are odd children of the root node. From these definitions, we have the first established property of bipartite graphs: 
  $$X \cap Y = \emptyset \text{ and } X \cup Y = V$$
</p>

<p>
  Showing the additional property about edges is a simple task: consider any arbitrary edge 
  $$e_k=(v_{e_k},v_{e_k}') \in E \implies v_{e_k}, v_{e_k}' \in V$$ 
  Because $T$ is an acyclic graph by definition, taking the convetion that the $0^{th}$ node of $T$ refers to the root node of $T$, it must be so that either
  <ol>
  <li>$\forall\ v_{e_k}$ in the $n^{th}$ hierarchy of $T$ where $n \in \Bbb N_0$, $v_{e_k}$ is the parent node to $v_{e_k}'$ which lies in the $(n+1)^{th}$ hierarchy of $T$</li>
  <li>$\forall\ v_{e_k}$ in the $(n+1)^{th}$ hierarchy of $T$ where $n \in \Bbb N_0$, $v_{e_k}$ is the child node to $v_{e_k}'$ which lies in the $n^{th}$ hierarchy of $T$</li>
  </ol>
  For either case with $n \ne 0$, 
  $$n \in 2\Bbb N_0 \iff (n + 1) \notin 2 \Bbb N_0$$
  meaning that if $v_{e_k}$ is in an even hierarchy of $T$, then $v_{e_k}'$ is in an odd hierarchy of $T$; the inverse statement holds as well. Hence,
  $$v_{e_k} \in X \iff v_{e_k}' \in Y,\ \forall\ n \in \Bbb N^*$$
  We can extend this to include the case where $n = 0$ by seeing that $v_{e_k}$ is the root node of $T$ (and hence is included in $X$) and that $v_{e_k}'$ is in an odd hierarchy of $T$, thus $v_{e_k}' \in Y$. The proof that $T$ is a bipartite graph follows from here.

## Formulating the Objective Function


<p>
  Let $T=G$ be as before, and let
  $$F_p=(\mathscr f_1,\dots,\mathscr f_p:p\leq n \in \Bbb N)$$ be a collection of some $p$ vertices in $T$ which represent a potential facility-location set (hereafter referred to as <i>median set</i>) for $T$. Let
  $$W=(w_1,\ldots,w_n:n \in \Bbb N)$$ be such that $w_i$ represents the weight for vertex $v_i \in V$; similarly, define
  $$A=(a_1,\ldots,a_m:m \in \Bbb N)$$ to be the (tree-metric) distance<sup><a href="#section2">[ii]</a></sup> between adjacent vertices such that, if
  $$e_k=(e_{k_1},e_{k_2})$$ where $e_{k_1},e_{k_2} \in V$, then
  $$a_k=\lVert e_k\rVert=\lVert e_{k_1} - e_{k_2} \rVert,\forall \ e_k \in E$$
</p>

<p>
  Let the distance between any two arbitrary vertices $v_i,v_j \in V$ be defined as the mapping $\delta:(v_i,v_j) \mapsto \delta(v_i,v_j)$, and then define the mapping $\psi:v_i \mapsto \psi(v_i)$ to be the minimum weighted distance between vertex $v_i$ and any facility within the potential median set; that is,
  $$\psi(v_i)=w_i \cdot\min_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \delta (v_i,\mathscr f_z)$$ Finally, let the potential cost of locating a facility at the location $\mathscr f_z$ be defined as the mapping $\gamma:\mathscr f_z \mapsto \gamma(\mathscr f_z)$.
</p>

<p>
  We are now ready to formulate our objective function for any given potential median set: we define the mapping $\Gamma: F_p \mapsto \Gamma(F_p)$ by
  $$\Gamma(F_p)=\sum_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \gamma(\mathscr f_z) +\sum_{v_i \in V} \psi(v_i)$$
  to be the objective function for any given potential median set $F_p \subseteq V$.
</p>

<br>





## Creating the General Linear Programming Problem
Because we wish to select from any arbitrary potential median set the one for which the objective function is minimized, our goal in solving the p-median problem is to find the median set $\mathscr F_p$ such that 
$$\mathscr F_p = \min_{F_p \subseteq V} \Gamma (F_p)$$
We will show that, with a few adjustments in terminology and symbology, this $\mathscr F_p$ fits the form of $\eqref{eq1}$. 




### Rearranging the Objective Function
<p>
  Looking just at $\Gamma (F_p)$ alone, we have that our objective function is equal to 
  $$\sum_{z=1}^p \gamma (\mathscr f_z) + \sum_{i=1}^n \psi (v_i)$$ then, using the fact that 
  $$\psi (v_i) = w_i \cdot \min_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \delta (v_i,\mathscr f_z)$$ our objective function can be written as
  $$\sum_{z=1}^p \gamma (\mathscr f_z) + \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \cdot \min_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \delta (v_i,\mathscr f_z)$$
</p>

<p>
  To proceed any further, we need to formulate the two-variable function $\delta$ using known quantities given from the problem. For the first case, suppose the vertex in question is an element of the median set; that is, $v_i \in F_p$. If we now define the notation $$\delta (v_i, F_p) = \min_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \delta (v_i,\mathscr f_z)$$ 
then it follows that $\delta (v_i,F_p) = 0$. 
</p>

<p>
  For all other cases, we suppose that $v_i \notin F_p$. Then, $\forall\ \mathscr f_z \in F_p$ because $T$ is connected, there exists some set $K \subset V$ such that every element $k \neq v_i \text{ and } k \neq \mathscr f_z$ in $K$ lies on a path connecting $v_i$ to $\mathscr f_z$; furthermore, because $T$ is acyclic, this path is <il>the</il> unique path connecting $v_i$ and $\mathscr f_z$. Before proceeding, let the mapping $\phi: (v_i, \mathscr f_z) \mapsto K$ formally define $K$ for a given $v_i,\mathscr f_z$ when the vertex and facility in question are ambiguous.
</p>

<p>
  Let us denote the $q$ elements $k_q \in K$ to be such that 
  $$k_q=\mathscr f_z \text{ and } \forall\ k_r\ |\ r = 1,2,\ldots,q-1,\  \exists\ e_{k_r} \in E\ |\ e_{k_r} = (k_r,k_{r+1})$$
  Hence, each subset of vertices $K$ of $V$ defined in the above way induces a subset of edges $(e_{k_1},e_{k_2},\ldots,e_{k_{q-1}}) \subset E$. As before, we define the mapping $\Phi: K \mapsto \epsilon$ to formally define $\epsilon$ for a given $K$ for a given $v_i,\mathscr f_z$ by 
  $$\epsilon = \Phi (K) = (\Phi \circ \phi)(v_i,\mathscr f_z)$$
  which is composed of $q-1$ elements 
  $$\epsilon_r = \Phi_r (k) = (\Phi \circ \phi)_r (v_i,\mathscr f_z)$$
  We define one final mapping before proceeding: $\varepsilon: (v_i,\mathscr f_z,r) \mapsto \epsilon$ as 
  $$\varepsilon_r (v_i,\mathscr f_z) = (\Phi \circ \phi)_r (v_i,\mathscr f_z)= \epsilon_r$$
</p>

<p>
  Recall that the set $A$ is defined such that $\forall\ a_k \in A,\ \exists \text{ corresponding } e_k \in E$. Hence, being careful about our notation, $\forall\ \epsilon_r \in \epsilon \subset E,\ \exists \text{ corresponding } a_{\epsilon_r} \in A_{\epsilon} \subset A$. Thus, it follows that the subset $A_{\epsilon} \subset A$ represents the distances between each adjacent node within the set $K \in V$, $\forall\ v_i \in V$ and $\forall\ \mathscr f_z \in F_p$, hence $$\delta (v_i,\mathscr f_z) = \sum_{r=1}^{q-1} a_{\epsilon_r}= \sum_{r=1}^{q-1} \varepsilon_r (v_i,\mathscr f_z)$$ leading to $$\psi (v_i) = w_i \cdot \min_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \sum_{r=1}^{q-1} \varepsilon_r (v_i,\mathscr f_z)$$ and thus $$\Gamma (F_p) = \sum_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \gamma (\mathscr f_z) + \sum_{v_i \in V} w_i \cdot \min_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \sum_{r=1}^{q-1} \varepsilon_r (v_i,\mathscr f_z)$$
</p>


<p>
  A quick review of our notation used thus far:
  <ul>
  <li> $T=(V,E)$ is our tree $T$ representing our topological location model with vertices $V$ representing demands nodes and edges $E$ representing paths between adjacent demand nodes </li>
  <li> $F_p \subset V$ is some arbitrary collection of $p$ nodes selected from possible demand nodes 
  </ul>
</p>




<p>
  Let $\xi$ denote the sum of all $\varepsilon$ for given $v_i,\mathscr f_z$: $$\xi (v_i,\mathscr f_z) = \sum_{r=1}^{q-1} \varepsilon_r (v_i,\mathscr f_z) $$
  Our objective function has now become $$\Gamma (F_p) = \sum_{\mathscr f_z \in F_p} \gamma (\mathscr f_z) + \sum_{v_i \in V} w_i \cdot \xi (v_i,\mathscr f_z) $$
  Finally, because there exists a one-to-one correspondence between $v_i \in V \text{ and } i=1,2,\cdots,n$ as well as between $\mathscr f_z \in F_p \text{ and } z=1,2,\cdots,n$
